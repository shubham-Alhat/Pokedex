# Improvements Needed.

## URL FOR POKEMON IMAGES.
### URL : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/3523482c5365843799c8acf5fcad7cccd57fea9d/sprites/pokemon/other/dream-world/${Pokemon-id}.svg"

## 1) Dynamic Grid Responsiveness:

### Add a resize event listener to adjust the number of grid columns dynamically based on window size. This ensures the layout remains responsive on different screen sizes.

## 2) Sort Functionality:

### Implement sorting logic for Pokémon cards, such as sorting by name or ID, using the sortButton for user-friendly interaction.

## 3) Error Handling for Fetch:

### Use a try-catch block to gracefully handle errors from the API or network issues, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## 4) Fix Image Loading:

### Correct the Pokémon image URL logic to ensure that all images load properly without broken links.

## 5) Encapsulate Reusable Code:

### Create helper functions for repetitive tasks such as creating card elements and calculating the number of columns, enhancing code maintainability and readability.

## 6) Clear Hidden Class Logic:

### Simplify and streamline the logic for toggling the hidden class in the sort button event listener for better readability.

## 7) Add Loading Feedback:

### Display a loading spinner or message while fetching Pokémon data to inform users of the ongoing operation.

## 8) Optimize Initial Fetch Logic:

### Properly manage id and i variables during the initial data fetch to avoid skipping or duplicating Pokémon entries.
